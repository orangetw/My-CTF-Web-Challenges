    # This option will reject all requests, which contain an
    # encoded percent sign (%25) or backslash (%5C) in the URL
    # If you are sure, that your webapp doesn't use such
    # URLs, enable the option to prevent double encoding attacks.

    # After setting JkStripSession to "On", mod_jk will
    # strip all ";jsessionid=..." from request URLs it
    # does *not* forward to a backend.
    # This is useful, if all links in a webapp use
    # URLencoded session IDs and parts of the static
    # content should be delivered directly by Apache.
    # Of course you can also do it with mod_rewrite.
    # Since: 1.2.21

    # Start a separate thread for internal tasks like
    # idle connection probing, connection pool resizing
    # and load value decay.

    # either move this block into the virtual host

    # in the virtual host.
    # Add an appropriate authentication method here!


    # If you want to put all mounts into an external file

    # The URL syntax "a|b" instantiates two mounts at once,
    # the first one is "a", the second one is "ab".

    # IMPORTANT: Mounts and virtual hosts
    # If you are using VirtualHost elements, you
    # - can put mounts only used in some virtual host into its VirtualHost element 
    # - can copy all global mounts to it using "JkMountCopy On" inside the VirtualHost
    # - can copy all global mounts to all virtual hosts by putting
    #   "JkMountCopy All" into the global server
    # Since: 1.2.26
