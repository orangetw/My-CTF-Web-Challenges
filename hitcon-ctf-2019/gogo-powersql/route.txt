#
#   Routes may require authentication and that users possess certain abilities.
#   The abilities, extensions, methods and redirect keywords use comma separated tokens to express a set of 
#       required options, or use "|" separated tokens for a set of alternative options. This implements AND/OR.
#   The protocol keyword may be set to http or https. The redirect status may be "*" to match all HTTP status codes.
#   Multiple redirect fields are permissible.
#
#   Examples:
#
#   Universally redirect http to https for secure communications
#       route uri=/ protocol=http redirect=*@https handler=redirect
#
#   Form based login pattern. 
#       route uri=/pub/
#       route uri=/action/login methods=POST handler=action redirect=200@/ redirect=401@/pub/login.html
#       route uri=/action/logout methods=POST handler=action redirect=200@/pub/login.html
#       route uri=/ auth=form handler=continue redirect=401@/pub/login.html
#
